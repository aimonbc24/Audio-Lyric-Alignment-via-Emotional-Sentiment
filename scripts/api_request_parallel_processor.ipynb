    "Using the OpenAI API to process lots of text quickly takes some care.\n",
    "If you trickle in a million API requests one by one, they'll take days to complete.\n",
    "If you flood a million API requests in parallel, they'll exceed the rate limits and fail with errors.\n",

    "- Makes requests concurrently, to maximize throughput\n",
    "- Throttles request and token usage, to stay under rate limits\n",
    "- Retries failed requests up to {max_attempts} times, to avoid missing data\n",
